We believe that salvation is found by placing our faith in what Jesus did for us on the cross. We believe Jesus rose from the dead and is coming again.</p><p>… water baptism is a symbol of the cleansing power of the blood of Christ and a testimony to our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>… in the regular taking of Communion as an act of remembering what the Lord Jesus did for us on the cross.</p><p>… every believer should be in a growing relationship with Jesus by obeying God’s Word, yielding to the Holy Spirit, and by being conformed to the image of Christ.</p><p>… as children of God, we are overcomers and more than conquerors, and God intends for each of us to experience the abundant life He has in store for us.</p>"
