Pray this aloud: \"Lord Jesus, I repent of my sins. Come into my heart. Wash me clean. I make you my Lord and Savior, Amen.\" We believe that if you prayed that simple prayer, you have been born again. You are starting with a clean slate, and you have entered into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Keep God first place in your life. Learn to pray; prayer is simply talking to God like you would talk to a friend. Mark today's date, write it down in your Bible – this is the day of new beginnings in your life!</p>"

The efficiencies of these authorized systems enable tickets to be sold very quickly, especially for tickets in high demand.</p><p>Please understand that preferential treatment is not extended to any group of consumers when tickets are placed on sale to the general public.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have little control over patron conduct after their purchase request is fulfilled. However, we reserve the right to block access to or cancel a ticket order of any user:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>utilizing automated means to process or place ticket orders fraudulently, or</li><li>whose ticket order exceeds the stated limit</li></ol><p>While some states have laws that deal with scalping, those laws are rarely enforced. We take reports of misconduct of users, third-party advertisers, service providers, or product providers seriously, and those reports and feedback are immediately directed to the group(s) responsible to investigate and take appropriate action.</p><p>On some occasions, the tickets you see posted on unauthorized resale sites do not actually exist, and the seller has posted the ad in hopes of securing a buyer and being able to secure tickets located in the section advertised. Quite often the tickets do not materialize, and the defrauded buyer ends up receiving invalid tickets or tickets located much farther from the stage than what was originally offered in the seller's ad. Most resellers operate multiple websites and/or post the same tickets on different resale sites all across the country. Purchasing event tickets and/or participating in the process of purchasing through resellers exposes a buyer to great risk of being defrauded.</p><p>For your protection, we encourage you to purchase tickets only from the venue box office and/or the authorized ticketing company. That is the only way a consumer can be assured that they are buying an authentic, valid ticket. In addition, we strongly discourage people from purchasing tickets for more than the $15 face value.</p>"
